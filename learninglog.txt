1. When do you include class headers?

Header files are used to give access to the class interface specification.
Include the header when you want to use that class

2. Deal with non-full circular buffer when playback is attempted

3. The current implementation suffers from non-uniform frame playback
We need to decouple constant frame playback from other processing activities
to ensure exactly 30fps no matter what.

4. How does OpenCV store the camera object?
	How does it store the raw camera frames?
	How does it read the camera frames? Sequential? Are any frames lost in between?
	
5. Make sure you draw 30 fps AND you read 30fps from the camera...
